The website is tested using some test tools. Jmeter is one of them. The test cases are stored under the jmeter folder. The [https://code.google.com/p/portfolio-recipe/source/browse/trunk/RecipeProject/src/test/resources/jmeter/Thread%20Group.jmx Thread Group.jmx] encapsulates a number of tests. One of that test is a performance test.

=PERFORMANCE TEST=

The performance test is intended to collect data about the response time of the home page of the website. This is achieved by performing a load Testing that puts the home page to a work level that could push the home page to its limit. The work level is set to 400 users accessing the home page concurrently.

To do this, a jmeter with the following components are created:

  * A Thread Group that records 400 users accessing the home  page. The ramp up period is 400 seconds, which means that each user will open the home page every 1 second. The loop is set to 50, which means that the test is repeated 50 times per user.
 
  * An HTTP Request that records a URL and a port of the home page.

  * A Simple Controller that records the steps that each user perform in the test. The controller defined in this test records two steps: opening the home page, and opening the first recipe in the home page.

  * An aggregate report listener that records the average and median response time of the homepage.
