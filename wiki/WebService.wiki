This page is intended to describe RESTful web services built into the project.The web services produce recipes in the database in a JSON format.

=Importing the Required API=

 This is done by an API named Jackson, which is a multi-purpose Java library for processing JSON data format. To use the API, a dependency for Jackson is recorded in the pom.xml
{{{
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.codehaus.jackson</groupId>
   <artifactId>jackson-mapper-asl</artifactId>
   <version>1.9.2</version>
</dependency>
}}}

=Controller=

Once the Jackson has been added as a dependency, this method will act as a webservice endpoint:

{{{
/**
 * @return every recipe in the database in a json format
 */
@RequestMapping(value="/json.allRecipes", method = RequestMethod.GET,produces = "application/json")
    public @ResponseBody List<Recipe> findAllRecipe(){
    	return recipeService.findAll();
    }
}}}

=Web Service Client=

A client intended to produce a list of recipes from the json produced by the webservice is built into the project.JSONClientTest
