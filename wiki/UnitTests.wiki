This page describes how unit tests classes are developed for the project. The unit test has two components: the infrastructure classes, and the unit test classes.

There are are two type of infrastructure classes: controller infrastructure, which is a set of classes intended to setup the required infrastructure for running unit tests of a controller. And, service infrastructure , which is a set of classes intended to setup the required infrastructure for testing service classes.

=Controller Infrastructure=

The first class is the [https://code.google.com/p/portfolio-recipe/source/browse/trunk/RecipeProject/src/test/java/com/safe/stack/config/ControllerTestConfig.java ControllerTestConfig] class. This class is annotated with Configuration annotation to indicate that this class is an Application context class. The profile annotation indicates a profile associated with this class, which is test.

{{{
@Configuration
@Profile("test")
public class ControllerTestConfig {

}
}}}

The second infrastructure class is the [https://code.google.com/p/portfolio-recipe/source/browse/trunk/RecipeProject/src/test/java/com/safe/stack/web/controller/AbstractControllerTest.java AbstrackControllerTest] class. This class is intended to be a superclass for every unit tests class that test a controller. This class has some annotations. The RunWith annotation describes that child classes of this class will be run by a unit test. The  context configuration annotation describes the Configuration class used by this class. The active profile annotation indicates that child classes of this class should use the test profile for running unit tests.

{{{
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = { ControllerTestConfig.class })
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@Ignore
public class AbstractControllerTest {

}
}}}

=Service Infrastructure=

The first infrastructure class is [https://code.google.com/p/portfolio-recipe/source/browse/trunk/RecipeProject/src/test/java/com/safe/stack/config/ServiceTestConfig.java ServiceTestConfig] class. This class defines an application context for testing service layer classes. 

The ImportResource annotation indicates that this class loads xml files that records the required configurations for running a test for a service layer class.
